# FAQ-accordion

ðŸš€ **The challenge**<br>
The challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I use HTML, CSS, and JS to complete the challenge. 

Users should be able to:

**Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked<br>
**Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone<br>
**View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size<br>
**See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
